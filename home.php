		<h2>How I Got Here</h2>
		<p>
		Orignially, I was a Journalism student at Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville studying the art of writing columns, presenting infomtation live, on camera to viewers, and interviewing the local population. After some time, I seeked a change - to learn something I never thought I was capable of doing. After some shocked conversations with my advisors, I switched to CS and never looked back!
